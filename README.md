# Detection-of-road-lane-lines
Detection of Road Lane Lines is a computer vision project that identifies lane markings from real-time or recorded video using image processing techniques like Canny edge detection, Hough Transform, and deep learning. It enhances driver assistance and autonomous driving by accurately detecting lane boundaries.
