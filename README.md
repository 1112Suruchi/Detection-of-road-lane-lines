# Detection-of-road-lane-lines
This project aims to identify lane markings on roads using computer vision and image processing techniques. The system processes images or video frames captured from a vehicle’s camera to detect lane boundaries, which is essential for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving applications.

**Key Features and Methodology:**
Image Preprocessing:

Converts input images to grayscale to simplify processing.
Applies Gaussian blur to reduce noise and improve edge detection.
Edge Detection:

Uses Canny Edge Detection to highlight lane boundaries.
Region of Interest (ROI) Selection:

Defines a specific area in the image where lane lines are expected, ignoring irrelevant parts of the scene.
Lane Detection using Hough Transform:

Applies the Hough Line Transform to detect straight lane lines.
If the road has curved lanes, polynomial fitting techniques can be used for better accuracy.
Deep Learning Approach (if implemented):

Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) or deep learning models to enhance lane detection accuracy.
Real-Time Processing:

The system is optimized for real-time performance, making it useful for self-driving vehicles and lane-keeping assist systems.

**Applications:**
Autonomous Vehicles: Helps in self-driving cars by identifying lanes and maintaining the vehicle’s position.
Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS): Assists drivers in lane-keeping and departure warnings.
Traffic Management: Can be used in surveillance systems for monitoring road lanes.

**Conclusion:**
This project plays a crucial role in road safety by ensuring accurate lane detection, which is essential for both autonomous and human-driven vehicles. By integrating traditional image processing techniques with deep learning (if applicable), it enhances the reliability of lane detection systems.
